# Page-Replacement-Algorithms
My program that implements two page replacement algorithms, FIFO (First-In-First-Out) and LRU (Least Recently Used). It reads a sequence of page references from a file and simulates memory management for a given memory size. The FIFO algorithm replaces the oldest page when a page fault occurs, while the LRU algorithm replaces the least recently used page. The code uses arrays to represent memory and tracks the state of memory after processing all page references, printing the number of page faults and the final state of memory for each algorithm.
